        My hobby is playing soccer in my free time. Whenever I finsh my school homework I go in the backyard and practice some soccr moves. I'm 12 years old and going to grade 7 this year. I love playing soccer because sometimes when I'm strested or sad about something soccer cools me down and makes me feel I can do anything. When I'm nervous about my school project or gardes in school I play soccer to refresh my brain and just have a good enjoy playng with my family and friends.
